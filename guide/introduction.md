# What is Vibekit?

Vibekit is a framework for building web applications with a unique architecture. It's designed to help you focus on your ideas and not the boilerplate.

At the core of a Vibekit application is the `vibespec.md` file. This file defines the core concepts of your application:

*   **Things:** The nouns of your application. The main entities that your application manages.
*   **Events:** The verbs of your application. The actions that can be performed on your Things.
*   **State:** The current state of your application. The data that is stored and managed by your application.

Vibekit takes this `vibespec.md` file and generates a web application with a RESTful API for your Things and Events. It also provides a plugin system that allows you to extend the core functionality of your application.
